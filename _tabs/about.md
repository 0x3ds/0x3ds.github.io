I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on offensive security amongst others.  

I enjoy Penetration Testing, and at the same time I try to improve my Red Team skills.
Hack The Box is one of my favourite platforms to learn and test my skills. 
But beyond that, I am also very interested in OS internals, malware development, and advanced tradecraft.

The purpose behind this site/blog is to have a personal space where I can showcase write-ups for Hack the Box labs and challenges. I plan to also utilise this blog to include interesting articles I find, as well as research I conduct in my own homelab. Ultimately I want to document my learning journey and share the knowledge with others along the way.


## Focus Areas
---
- **Penetration Testing & Red Teaming** — uncovering vulnerabilities through realistic adversarial simulations.  
- **Malware Development & Reverse Engineering** — understanding software behavior from both offensive and defensive perspectives.  
- **Programming** — developing tools in C, Go, and Python.
- **Continuous Learning** — exploring new techniques through labs, research, and challenges such as Hack The Box.


## Certificates
---
- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- HacktheBox Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS) 
- More on the way!
